PCSC-Perl is wrapper built around the PCSC/lite library
[http://www.linuxnet.com] from David CORCORAN. The PCSC/lite
library is an abstraction layer that allows standardized
communications with a wide range of smart card readers. The
native API for PCSC/lite is C. 

The Perl wrapper lets you access the PCSC/lite API with Perl
instead of the native C language. This will hopefully help
you to quickly develop an application prototype or a
personalisation script.
