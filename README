History:
========

1.4.2 - 6 August 2004, Ludovic ROUSSEAU
    - allow to use SCARD_PROTOCOL_T0 | SCARD_PROTOCOL_T1 as the protocol
	  this is used by gscriptor 1.4.0

1.4.1 - 4 July 2004, Ludovic ROUSSEAU
    - Card/Card.pm:
     . ISO7816Error(): return an error if given $sw if not 5 chars long
       "xx xx"
     . Transmit(): return (undef) if the protocol is not defined. This
       happens if you change a T=0 card with a T=1 (or vice versa) and
       try to exchange an APDU without disconnecting first.
    - PCSCperl.h: replace LPCSTR by LPCTSTR (pcsc-lite 1.2.9 beta4)

1.4.0 - 20 May 2004, Ludovic ROUSSEAU
    - use a new Control() API to reflect the change in SCardControl() in
      pcsc-lite. We now have
      $RecvData = $hCard->Control($control_code, \@SendData);
    - load libpcsclite.so.1 instead of libpcsclite.so.0

1.3.1 - 2 April 2004, Ludovic ROUSSEAU
    - do not use PCSCLITE_MAX_CHANNELS anymor since it is no more
      defined by pcsc-lite > 1.2.0 and is not defined under Windows
    - test.pl: add demo code for GetStatusChange()
    - PCSC.pod: document GetStatusChange()
    - allow commands to be in the form "00A40100020100" instead of just
      "00 A4 01 0 0 02 01 00"

1.3.0 - 13 December 2003, Ludovic ROUSSEAU
    - add support of SCardControl with $out = $hContext->Control (\@in);
      Thanks to Andrew Kay.
    - more support of Windows PC/SC and compiler.
      Thanks to Andrew Kay and Troy Curtiss
    - array_to_ascii() returns an empty string for an empty list
    - add Makefile_win.PL for Windows
    - Card.pm: by default use T=0 | T=1 protocols instead of just T=0

1.2.2 - 27 May 2003, Ludovic ROUSSEAU
    - add two constant definitions in PCSC.pm. Thanks to Ville Skyttä
      for report and patch
    - add a PL_FILES section in Makefile*.PL to avoid problem since we
      have Makefile.PL and Makefile_OSX.PL. Again thanks goes to Ville
      Skyttä
    - Also thanks to Wolfgang Hommel for uploading the package to CPAN
      and registering the official name Chipcard::PCSC (Wolfgang is
      maintainer of the Chipcard::CTAPI wrapper)

1.2.1 - 24 May 2003, Ludovic ROUSSEAU
    - redesign the Makefile.PL to make the modules at least installable
    - add Card/Makefile.PL to also install Chipcard::PCSC::Card
    - modified test.pl to accept any SW in TransmitWithCheck

1.2.0 - 9 May 2003, Ludovic ROUSSEAU
    - naming scheme migration from PCSC to Chipcard::PCSC
    - add TransmitWithCheck() and Chipcard::PCSC::Card::ISO7816Error()
      functions

1.1.3 - 7 Nov 2002, Ludovic ROUSSEAU
    - small modifications to support Perl 5.8

1.1.2 - 28 Aug 2002, Ludovic ROUSSEAU
    - small modification to link against libpcsclite.so.0 instead of
      libpcsclite.so since libpcsclite.so should only be available on
      development platforms (-dev packages).

1.1.1 - 7 Mar 2002, Ludovic ROUSSEAU
    - small typesetting modifications od .pod files

1.1.0 - 6 Mar 2002, Ludovic ROUSSEAU
    - create this README file with the history
    - complete reindentation of .pod files

1.0.9 - 5 Mar 2002, Ludovic ROUSSEAU
    - the minium APDU length is 4 bytes and not 5
    - correctly test if a digit is hexa or not

1.0.8 - 18 Oct 2001, Ludovic ROUSSEAU
