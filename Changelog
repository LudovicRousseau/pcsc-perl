2001-09-04  Lionel Victor  <lvictor@trinity>

	* test/multiple_readers.pl, test/single_reader.pl:
	Now using the real double typed magical scalar $PCSC::errno to report
	errors instead of the old $! which was buggy.

	* test/multiple_readers.pl, test/single_reader.pl:
	updated the files so that they now use the 'new' package architecture
	i.e.: PCSC + PCSC::Card insteead of PCSC + PCSCCard...

	* PCSC.pm:
	tried to make the @EXPORT @ISA $VERSION variable use more standard (At
	least I hope so)

	* PCSC.pm:
	Fixed a bug in PCSC::ascii_to_array(). The returned array was global
	therefore, each call to the function was returning all the arrays since
	the object initialization.
	I now use 'use strict' to avoid such problems in the future but I do not
	know if I do it the proper way... I had to modify EXPORT and such to make
	it run

	* test/multiple_readers.pl, test/single_reader.pl:
	More cosmetic changes

	* PCSC/Card.pm, PCSC/Card.pod, PCSC.pm, PCSC.pod, PCSC.xs, test.pl:
	Applied a patch from somebody who apparently wants to stay anonymous.
	This patch includes mostly cosmetic changes and extra documentation about
	array_to_ascii() and ascii_to_array(). Thanks to this contributor for his
	help and time
